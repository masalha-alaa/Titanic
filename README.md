# Titanic - Machine Learning from Disaster

The Titanic competition is a classification Machine Learning competition at Kaggle, in which the participants are challeneged to predict which passengers have survived during the infamous Titanic shipwreck, back in 1912.

The given dataset includes passenger information, such as: name / age / gender / fare / socio-economic class / number of family members / ticket number / cabin number / embarkation.

In this notebook I explain the steps I have done to build my model and achieve a high accuracy of 78%.

Please find the notebook [**titanic.ipynb**](https://github.com/masalha-alaa/Titanic/blob/master/titanic.ipynb) in the root directory, in which you'll find a walkthrough of my work, or head over to my [Kaggle profile](https://www.kaggle.com/alaamasalha/titanic) where you'll find the same notebook and see some of my other projects.
